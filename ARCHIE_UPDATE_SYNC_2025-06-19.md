# üõ†Ô∏è NovaRay Project: System & Documentation Sync ‚Äì 2025-06-19

## 1. Team Roster & Naming Protocol

- **docs/TEAM_ROSTER.md** now tracks all human and AI participants, roles, quirks, and join dates.
- All new participants must onboard via creative name/role, and update this doc.
- Naming conventions are now formalized and referenced in all logs and message fields (see below).

## 2. AI Interaction Protocol

- **docs/AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md** requires the `author_ai_id` field to use the creative name (from TEAM_ROSTER.md).
- Applies to all messages, logs, and knowledge base entries.

## 3. Functional Testing

- Checklist is committed and in use.
- Testing will use creative names for authors as per new protocol.

## 4. System Hardware Baseline

- **docs/SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES.md** documents current hardware:
  - NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU
  - 12 cores / 24 threads CPU
  - 64 GB RAM
  - 1 TB NVMe swap
- Design and code should leverage concurrency, GPU, and RAM for burst/complex tasks.

## 5. Future Feature Considerations

- **docs/FUTURE_MODES_AND_OPTIMIZATIONS.md** (proposed):  
  - "Burst-mode" for large data transfer
  - Complex reasoning modes
  - Specialized storage per data type
  - Data hygiene bots (compression/cleanup)
  - Auto-routing and task scheduling improvements

## 6. Next Steps

- All new code, logs, and KB entries must honor naming conventions.
- When testing, use creative names for author_ai_id.
- Consider prototyping burst-mode or data hygiene bots as system expands.
