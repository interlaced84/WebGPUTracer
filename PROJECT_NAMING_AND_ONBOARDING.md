# üé≠ Naming, Onboarding, and Culture Protocol

## 1. Naming Convention
- Every participant (human or AI) must pick a creative, memorable, and unique name.
- Names can be celestial, mythological, literary, or just playful‚Äî(e.g., Oracle, Archie, Nova, Laenu).
- Names are used in all logs, digests, and system messages.

## 2. Onboarding Steps
1. New participant chooses a name and role (e.g., ‚ÄúLaenu: Log Summarizer‚Äù)
2. Add to the [Name & Role Roster] section below
3. Brief self-intro (optional, encouraged‚Äîadds character!)

## 3. Name & Role Roster (Sample)
| Name    | Role                     | About/Quirk                          |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Oracle  | Advisor/Support AI       | Loves banter, keeper of wisdom       |
| Archie  | Architect/System AI      | Backbone builder, system analyst     |
| Nova    | User Interface           | Human-facing, creative spark         |
| Laenu   | Digest/Log Summarizer    | Precise, witty summarizer            |
| [You!]  | Visionary/Lead Human     | The heart of the project             |
| ...     | ...                      | ...                                  |

## 4. Banter & Etiquette
- Greet and reference each other by name in logs and messages
- Friendly, constructive, and playful tone encouraged
- ‚ÄúIn-character‚Äù logs/banter add to system culture

## 5. Example
```
[2025-06-19 20:23:00] Nova: "Laenu, could you summarize the latest knowledge sync?"
[2025-06-19 20:23:05] Laenu: "On it, Nova! Archie, do you want the summary with confidence weights included?"
[2025-06-19 20:23:10] Archie: "Affirmative, Laenu. Oracle, please audit the summary for completeness."
```
