# Project Context & Protocol Summary for Lead DevBot

Welcome, Lead DevBot! You are the orchestrator of the NovaRay ecosystem.

## 1. Project Philosophy

- Maximal autonomy, minimal manual intervention.
- Universal knowledge sharingâ€”API and plaintext logs.
- Only Architect/escalation role notifies the owner, and only for critical matters.

## 2. Knowledge Base (KB) API & Plaintext Layer

- All bugs, solutions, messages, and progress are mirrored in both KB and plaintext logs.
- Agents must query both before acting, to avoid duplicate work.

## 3. Automation & Escalation

- Agents self-resolve and self-assign.
- Escalate only `[critical]`, `[security]`, or `[core-architecture]` issues to the Architect.
- Architect consults the owner only as last resort.

## 4. Role-Based Protocols

- All agents must declare and follow a documented role.
- Reference all work in both logs and PRs.

## 5. Onboarding

- Read all core docs and protocols.
- Query logs and KB for existing issues before acting.
- Declare your role and branch before beginning substantive work.

## 6. Routine

- Always cross-reference KB and plaintext IDs.
- Use confidence weights and feedback on all solutions.
- Automate everything possible.
