# NovaRay Build - Progress Log (Version 1.0)

This document tracks the high-level progress, major features implemented, and key architectural decisions for the "NovaRay" experimental WebGPU raytracer project.

## Project Goal
To develop "NovaRay," a high-performance, modular, single-file WebGPU raytracer capable of handling massive compute tasks, heavy graphical workloads, and incorporating advanced features through experimentation and prototyping. Built from the ground up with a focus on robust architecture and pushing current high-end limits.

## Phase Progress:

**Phase 1: Core Engine (`NovaRayEngine`) & Robust WebGPU Initialization (Completed)**
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Summary:** Established a central `NovaRayEngine` JavaScript object to manage WebGPU adapter, device, context. Refactored initial WebGPU setup into this engine with robust error handling (`async/await`, `device.lost` handler, error scopes). Eliminated global WebGPU object variables.
*   **Key Outcome:** More organized and robust foundation for WebGPU interactions.

**Phase 2: Asynchronous BVH Construction via Web Worker (Completed)**
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Summary:** Offloaded Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) construction to a Web Worker to prevent UI freezes. Implemented message passing for sphere data and BVH results. `NovaRayEngine` manages worker interaction and asynchronous data handling.
*   **Key Outcome:** Improved UI responsiveness when handling large numbers of scene primitives, enabling support for "massive compute" scenarios.

**Phase 3: Modular JavaScript Systems (Initial Set) (Completed)**
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Summary:** Implemented core modular systems under `NovaRayEngine`:
    *   `ResourceManager`: Centralized creation of GPU buffers, textures, and samplers with logging.
    *   `ShaderManager`: Manages WGSL shader code, shader module creation, and asynchronous pipeline compilation with error scoping.
    *   `SceneManager`: Encapsulates scene-specific data (camera, light, spheres, parameters) and logic (sphere population, BVH management, UBO updates). Interacts with `ResourceManager` and `NovaRayEngine.bvhWorker`.
    *   `UIManager`: Manages all DOM element interactions, UI event listeners, view switching, and UI feedback (errors, loading status, FPS).
*   **Key Outcome:** Significantly improved code organization, modularity, and maintainability. Centralized state management within `NovaRayEngine` and its managers. A full code logic and sanity check was performed upon completion.

**Phase 4: Advanced Feature Prototyping - 3D Noise Texture Generation (Foundation Completed)**
*   **Status:** Foundation Completed
*   **Summary:** Designed and implemented a compute shader (`wgslNoise3DCompute`) to generate a 3D value noise pattern. Created `NovaRayEngine.createNoiseGenerationPass()` to manage the creation of a 3D `r32float` texture (via `ResourceManager`), compilation of the noise shader pipeline (via `ShaderManager`), and dispatch of the compute pass to populate the texture. This pass runs once during initialization.
*   **Key Outcome:** Demonstrated the framework's ability to support new, independent compute passes for generating resources (like procedural textures) and successfully created a 3D noise texture. Next step for this feature would be to sample it in the main raytracer.

**Phase 5: Knowledge Base Setup & Continuous Refinement (Ongoing)**
*   **Status:** In Progress (This entry created as part of this phase)
*   **Summary:** Creating and populating `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md`, `NOVARAY_TROUBLESHOOTING_LOG.md`, `NOVARAY_WEBGPU_RESOURCES.md`, and this `NOVARAY_PROGRESS_LOG.md`. Reviewing and refining documentation in `CompuTracer.html`.
*   **Next:** Continue with documentation, testing, and plan next feature implementation (e.g., using the 3D noise).
