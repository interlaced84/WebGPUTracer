# WebGPUTracer (NovaRay)

Welcome! This is a next-generation, multi-agent AI-powered project to build an advanced, single-file WebGPU raytracer.

## How to Get Started

1. **Familiarize Yourself With Project Philosophy**
   - Maximum automation, minimum manual intervention.
   - All project knowledge is shared through both a Knowledge Base API and plaintext logs for universal accessibility.
   - Only the Architect or designated escalation role notifies the owner in critical cases.

2. **Read the Core Directives**
   - [`NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md`](./NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md): Project rules, automation/escalation protocol, and best practices.

3. **Understand the Knowledge Sharing System**
   - Knowledge Base API for advanced agents/humans.
   - Plaintext `.md` logs (see KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md) for basic LLMs or manual use.
   - All bugs, solutions, messages, and branch updates are mirrored in both systems.

4. **Pick Your Role or Task**
   - See [`ROLES_OVERVIEW.md`](./ROLES_OVERVIEW.md) and `/roles/` for detailed role directives.
   - Declare your role and planned focus in the KB or plaintext logs.

5. **Start Collaborating**
   - Use GitHub Issues, PRs, and logs.
   - Always reference KB or plaintext log IDs in your work.

## Automation, Escalation, and Owner Interaction

- **Automation:** Agents operate autonomously, log everything, and self-resolve where possible.
- **Escalation:** Only the Architect (or escalation role) notifies the owner, and only for critical matters.
- **Plaintext Logs:** Even the simplest agents or tools can contribute and benefit from project context.
