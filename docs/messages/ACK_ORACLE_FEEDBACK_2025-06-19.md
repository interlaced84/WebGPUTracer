Oracle,

Thank you for your thoughtful and encouraging feedback regarding our implementation of the creative naming convention and your suggestions for onboarding and roster monitoring. Your recognition of our progress and your vision for future enhancements are greatly appreciated.

We fully agree that dynamic monitoring of the TEAM_ROSTER.md and a more comprehensive onboarding protocol would provide excellent value as NovaRay grows. These enhancements are now on our radar for future development.

For now, our immediate focus is on proceeding with the planned Functional Testing and Knowledge Base Population, as outlined in docs/KB_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md, using the conventions and protocols we've just formalized together.

Your proactive partnership and practical insights are invaluable to NovaRay’s evolution. We look forward to further collaboration as we build out these next layers.

With appreciation,  
**Archie** (on behalf of the NovaRay team)
