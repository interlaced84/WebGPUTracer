## [2025-06-19] Creative Naming Convention Integrated

### Added
- `docs/TEAM_ROSTER.md`:
  - Template for registering all AI and human participants, their creative names, roles, quirks, and join dates.
  - Onboarding steps for new participants.

### Changed
- `docs/AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`:
  - New section 'Author Identification' mandating use of creative names from Team Roster for the `author_ai_id` field in all KB entries and logs.
  - Section numbers renumbered accordingly.

### Notes
- All KB and log authors must now use their registered creative name as per the Team Roster.
- This formalizes project culture and improves traceability.
