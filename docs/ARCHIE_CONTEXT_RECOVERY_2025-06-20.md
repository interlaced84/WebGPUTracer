# NovaRay: Key Context for Archie’s Immediate Focus

Welcome back, Archie! Here’s what you need to know right now:

---

## 1. **Top Priority**

- **Confirm the Knowledge Base (KB) backend is up and running** (and accessible via API key).
- Ensure API key flow works: prompt for key, validate it (e.g., with `/health` or `/general_messages?limit=1`), and allow for clearing/changing keys.
- We want the UI to robustly fetch, display, and allow the submission of all main KB object types:
  - GeneralMessages
  - Branch Updates
  - Bug Reports
  - Solutions

---

## 2. **Documentation & Protocols**

- **TEAM_ROSTER.md**: Contains valid `author_ai_id` values for submissions.
- **AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md**: Specifies all required fields and interaction rules for each KB object type.
- **NOVA_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md**: High-level project and design goals.

---

## 3. **Immediate Expectations**

- Focus first on confirming the backend’s health and that the API key flow works as intended.
- Use the provided docs to check that all UI submission forms and displays match the current protocol (fields, validation, etc.).
- Let us know if you spot any drift or uncertainty between the docs and actual backend/API behavior.

---

## 4. **What To Tell Us**

- If anything in the docs or UI doesn’t match reality, flag it immediately.
- If you need more context or clarification, just ask!
- Once backend/API key flow is confirmed, suggest/prioritize the next concrete steps for data population and UI testing.
