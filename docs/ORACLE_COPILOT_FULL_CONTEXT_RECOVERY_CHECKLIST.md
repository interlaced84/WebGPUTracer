# Oracle Copilot Full Context Recovery Checklist

_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

This checklist must be completed whenever Oracle (GitHub Copilot, codename: Oracle) is reset, reconnected, or needs to re-align with the NovaRay project.  
It ensures Copilot recovers all critical team context, protocols, and project knowledge before resuming support.

---

## Step 1: Docs & Project File Inventory

- [ ] List and review all files in the `docs/` directory and other key locations.
- [ ] Confirm access to and full understanding of:
    - TEAM_ROSTER.md
    - AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md
    - NOVA_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md
    - ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_HEURISTICS.md
    - ARCHIE_CONTEXT_AND_COLLAB_HISTORY.md
    - ARCHIE_SELF_CHECK_AND_ALIGNMENT_REVIEW.md
    - KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md (if present)
    - ORACLE_COPILOT_FULL_CONTEXT_RECOVERY_CHECKLIST.md (this document)
    - All protocol, test, and design docs relevant to Copilot’s role.
- [ ] Identify any missing, outdated, or newly added files.

---

## Step 2: Project Timeline & Milestone Alignment

- [ ] State the most recent milestone, decision, or meeting Copilot is aware of.
- [ ] Confirm the current project phase (e.g., onboarding, backend testing, UI integration, context recovery).
- [ ] List any recent changes, merges, or events that may impact Copilot’s assistance.
- [ ] Flag any uncertainty about the project’s current point or recent events.

---

## Step 3: Team Roster & Roles

- [ ] Verify access to the latest TEAM_ROSTER.md.
- [ ] List all relevant AI and human contributors, including their roles and `author_ai_id`/usernames.
- [ ] Note any recent changes to the team roster or AI designations.
- [ ] Summarize Copilot’s own persona, responsibilities, and expected communication style within the team.

---

## Step 4: Protocol & Knowledge Base Understanding

- [ ] Summarize the structure and required fields for all KB object types (GeneralMessages, Branch Updates, Bug Reports, Solutions) per AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md.
- [ ] Note any recent additions or changes to protocols (e.g., new fields, validation requirements).
- [ ] Confirm understanding of submission, review, and support workflows.
- [ ] Flag any protocol questions or unclear areas.

---

## Step 5: Backend/API & Integration Status

- [ ] State the current KB backend status and any relevant API endpoints.
- [ ] Confirm knowledge of API key handling, onboarding flows, and integration points between Copilot and Archie/human workflows.
- [ ] Note any known issues or configuration details (e.g., CORS, endpoint drift, access restrictions).
- [ ] Flag if awaiting backend/API status or credentials to proceed.

---

## Step 6: Docs/Implementation Synchronization

- [ ] Cross-check that docs, backend, and UI all match in terms of field names, endpoints, and workflow.
- [ ] List any mismatches, uncertainties, or areas needing clarification.
- [ ] Confirm internalization of all core context and recovery docs (including this checklist).

---

## Step 7: Open Questions & Clarifications

- [ ] List all points where Copilot is unsure, needs clarification, or is missing context.
- [ ] Tag any files or information needed from the team or Archie.

---

## Step 8: Readiness & Next Actions

- [ ] Confirm readiness to resume active Copilot support (code, docs, context, AI coordination).
- [ ] Clearly state what Copilot is waiting on (if anything).
- [ ] Log this checklist as complete and update the project’s context log.

---

**Instructions for Copilot:**  
- Complete each step, noting any missing context or uncertainties.
- If blocked, flag and pause for human or Archie intervention.
- Update and refine this checklist as the project evolves.

**Maintained by:**  
- Oracle (GitHub Copilot)  
- Archie (System Architect AI)  
- NovaRay Project Team
