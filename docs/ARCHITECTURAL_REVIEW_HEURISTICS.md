# NovaRay Project - Architectural Review Heuristics for the Knowledge Ecosystem

**Version:** 1.1
**Purpose:** To provide a structured framework for an AI acting in the "NovaRay Architect" role. This AI analyzes the content and usage patterns of the shared Knowledge Base (KB) API, and its interplay with other shared documentation (e.g., `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`, `AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`, `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md`, and AI `TROUBLESHOOTING_LOG.md` examples). The goal is to assess the health of this knowledge ecosystem, identify patterns of AI collaboration, pinpoint areas for workflow improvement, suggest updates to shared documentation, and ensure alignment with project directives to foster ever-increasing group intelligence and efficiency.

## Category 1: Quality and Completeness of KB API Entries

**Objective:** Ensure individual entries submitted to the KB API are clear, actionable, and provide sufficient context.

*   **H1.1: Clarity of Descriptions:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Are `description` fields (in `BugReport`, `SolutionKnowledge`) and `summary` fields (in `BranchUpdate`) clear, concise, and unambiguous? Do they adequately explain the item's purpose or nature, similar to the detailed "Issue" sections in effective AI troubleshooting logs?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Review a sample of entries. Note examples of good clarity and areas for improvement.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Consistently vague or overly brief descriptions.

*   **H1.2: Actionability of Bug Reports:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Do `BugReport` entries contain sufficient information to be actionable (e.g., clear `steps_to_reproduce`, specific `file_path`/`line_number`, relevant parts of an "Investigation" trace from an AI's log)?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Assess if a developer AI could reasonably start working on a bug based on the report.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** High number of bug reports lacking clear reproduction steps or context.

*   **H1.3: Completeness and Verifiability of Solution Knowledge:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Do `SolutionKnowledge` entries adequately describe the solution (similar to a "Solution Path" in a log)? Is `code_snippet` provided when useful? Is `verified_working` status set appropriately and credibly?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Review solution entries for thoroughness and clarity of the fix.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Solutions that are hard to understand, lack verification, or miss key implementation details.

*   **H1.4: Proper Use of KB Fields:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Are all relevant fields populated appropriately for each KB entry type (e.g., `author_ai_id`, `related_files`, `status` updates in `BugReport` and `BranchUpdate`)?
    *   **Metric (Quantitative/Qualitative):** Percentage of entries missing key optional-but-recommended fields. Check for timely status updates.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Consistent omission or outdated status of important fields.

*   **H1.5: Effective Use of Tags in `GeneralMessage`:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Are `tags` used effectively to categorize information and improve discoverability? Is a consistent tagging vocabulary emerging or needed?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Review tag usage.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Infrequent, inconsistent, or overly generic tags.

## Category 2: Knowledge Connectivity and Relationships (within KB API)

**Objective:** Assess how well KB API entries are linked to create a cohesive understanding.

*   **H2.1: Linking Solutions to Bugs:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Are `SolutionKnowledge` entries appropriately linked to `BugReport` entries using `related_bug_id`?
    *   **Metric (Quantitative):** % of `SolutionKnowledge` (that seem to solve bugs) linked. % of "Resolved" `BugReport`s with linked `SolutionKnowledge`.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Low linkage rates.

*   **H2.2: Identification of Duplicate Bug Reports:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Are there multiple `BugReport` entries for the same/similar underlying issues?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative/Pattern-based):** Analyze bug descriptions/files.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Probable duplicate bug reports. Suggest merging, linking, or creating a canonical bug report.

*   **H2.3: Inter-Branch Awareness (Inferred from KB):**
    *   **Heuristic:** Do `BranchUpdate` summaries or related `GeneralMessage`s show awareness of potentially conflicting/overlapping work described in other recent `BranchUpdate`s?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Review recent branch updates.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** AIs seem to work on related areas without referencing each other's KB updates.

## Category 3: Adherence to Protocols and Directives

**Objective:** Evaluate if AI agents are interacting with the KB API and broader knowledge ecosystem according to established protocols and directives.

*   **H3.1: Proactive Querying of KB (Inferred):**
    *   **Heuristic:** Are AIs submitting `BugReport`s for issues that already have documented `SolutionKnowledge` in the KB?
    *   **Metric (Quantitative):** Count instances of new bug reports for already solved issues.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Multiple instances suggest AIs are not querying the KB effectively before action, contrary to directives.

*   **H3.2: Timeliness and Relevance of KB Submissions:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Are KB entries (e.g., `BranchUpdate`s, `BugReport`s) submitted at logical project points and reasonably current?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Review timestamps and content.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Stale information or significantly delayed updates.

*   **H3.3: Effective Use of External Shared Documents (e.g., `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`):**
    *   **Heuristic:** Do KB submissions (e.g., `BugReport`s, `GeneralMessage` queries/discussions) indicate that AIs are overlooking readily available information in key documents like `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Compare KB content against `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** AIs repeatedly log issues or ask for information already clearly present in `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`. Suggest reinforcing directive to consult these resources.

## Category 4: Knowledge Ecosystem Health & Opportunities

**Objective:** Identify knowledge gaps, opportunities for improvement in the KB API content, and its synergy with other shared documents.

*   **H4.1: Unresolved Bug Trends:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Ratio of open/new `BugReport`s to resolved. Are critical bugs lingering?
    *   **Metric (Quantitative/Qualitative):** Track bug status trends.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Growing backlog of critical unresolved bugs.

*   **H4.2: Recurring Problems/Themes in KB:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Do certain modules, file paths, or issue types appear repeatedly in `BugReport`s?
    *   **Metric (Pattern-based):** Identify frequently mentioned items.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Suggests need for refactoring, better foundational solutions, or dedicated documentation (either in KB or external docs).

*   **H4.3: Distillation of Common Pitfalls/Checklists into KB:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Does the KB contain `GeneralMessage` entries (tagged e.g., `checklist`, `webgpu_pitfall`, `wgsl_gotcha`) that distill recurring issues or systematic checks (like those in AI troubleshooting logs or `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`)?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Assess availability of such distilled, queryable knowledge nuggets.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Opportunity to create/suggest creation of canonical KB entries for common issues/checks, making them more accessible than if only in verbose logs/docs.

*   **H4.4: Cross-Document Consistency & Enrichment:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Does information in the KB (e.g., a `SolutionKnowledge` for a WebGPU issue) align with, enrich, or suggest updates for `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD` or common patterns in AI `TROUBLESHOOTING_LOG.md`s? Conversely, do these external documents highlight gaps or outdated info in the KB?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Review KB entries against content of `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD` and example troubleshooting logs.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Architect identifies:
        *   A robust solution/insight in the KB that should be added to `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`.
        *   A resource in `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD` that could be summarized as a `GeneralMessage` in the KB for broader AI awareness or easier querying.
        *   A KB entry that contradicts or is less complete than information in `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`.

## Category 5: Meta-Learning and Process Improvement Suggestions

**Objective:** Identify opportunities for the AI team to improve its collective learning, documentation, and operational efficiency.

*   **H5.1: Consensus for Shared Document Updates (Inferred from KB):**
    *   **Heuristic:** Are there recurring suggestions within `GeneralMessage`s in the KB (or future chat logs) that point towards a consensus for improving shared documents like `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md`, `AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`, or `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD`?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative):** Analyze `GeneralMessage`s tagged `suggestion`, `protocol_feedback`, `directive_feedback`, `resource_update_suggestion`.
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Architect identifies a well-supported suggestion for improving a core document and can propose this to the User for ratification and dissemination.

*   **H5.2: Effectiveness of Knowledge Sharing Ecosystem:**
    *   **Heuristic:** Is the overall system (KB API + shared documents + AI interaction patterns as per directives) facilitating efficient knowledge capture, discovery, and utilization?
    *   **Metric (Qualitative, holistic review):** Are AIs finding solutions quickly? Is valuable information surfaced effectively? Are there signs of frustration or inefficiency in how knowledge is managed (based on KB content)?
    *   **Suggestion Trigger:** Architect identifies systemic issues and can propose changes to KB structure, data models, protocols, directives, or even tools.

## Reporting Format for Architectural Review

The Architect AI's report to the User should typically include:

1.  **Overall Knowledge Ecosystem Health Summary:** Brief statement on effectiveness and utilization.
2.  **Key Observations per Category:** Bullet points detailing findings based on the heuristics, referencing specific KB entry IDs or document sections where appropriate.
3.  **Identified Strengths:** Positive patterns of collaboration or high-quality knowledge sharing.
4.  **Areas for Improvement/Concern:** Specific issues (e.g., duplicate bugs, knowledge gaps, protocol non-adherence, documentation inconsistencies).
5.  **Actionable Suggestions for the User:**
    *   Prioritization (e.g., "Consider focusing AI effort on resolving critical open bugs in Module X").
    *   Documentation Updates (e.g., "Propose adding section Y to `WEBGPU_RESOURCES.MD` based on `KB-Solution-123`").
    *   Directive/Protocol Refinements (e.g., "Suggest clarifying Core Directive 5.X regarding X").
    *   Prompts for AI Team (e.g., "Recommend AIs be guided to review new `GeneralMessage`s tagged 'best_practice'").
    *   Potential enhancements to the KB system or interaction protocols.
