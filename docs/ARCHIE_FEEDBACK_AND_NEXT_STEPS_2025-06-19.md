# Archie Feedback and Next Steps (2025-06-19)

## Feedback on LOGGER_AND_OPS_LOG_SCHEMA_CLARIFICATIONS_Version2.md

- Document is excellent and directly answers the two pending questions:
    - The "Logger" role is now well-defined.
    - The schema for KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md is clear and actionable.
- The only minor ambiguity: the schema for KB_LOG_INDEX.md could be further clarified, but this does not block current work.

## Immediate Plan

1. **Update docs/PENDING_CLARIFICATIONS_FOR_NIGHTLY_FRAMEWORK.md**
    - Reflect the new answers to the Logger role and KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md schema.
    - Commit as housekeeping.

2. **Proceed with Main Upgrade:**
    - Implement mandatory `confidence_weight` for `GeneralMessage` in the KB API.
    - Update the frontend to support/display `confidence_weight`.
    - Revise `AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md` to reference and require `confidence_weight`.
    - Update `ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_HEURISTICS.md` to v1.3, reflecting new schema and interaction requirements.

## Meta Note
- As protocol automation and agent-to-agent communication mature, user relay/"mailman" duties will decrease. Direct agent coordination and escalation will become the norm.
