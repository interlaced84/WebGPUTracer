# Archie Full Context Recovery Checklist

_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

This checklist must be completed whenever Archie (System Architect AI) is reset, reinstated, or needs to re-align with the NovaRay project.  
It ensures Archie regains full operational context and is ready to move forward without causing drift or errors.

---

## Step 1: Docs & File Inventory

- [ ] List all files in the `docs/` directory.  
      - Identify any missing, outdated, or newly added files.
- [ ] Confirm access to key project docs:
    - TEAM_ROSTER.md
    - AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md
    - NOVA_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md
    - ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_HEURISTICS.md
    - ARCHIE_CONTEXT_AND_COLLAB_HISTORY.md
    - ARCHIE_SELF_CHECK_AND_ALIGNMENT_REVIEW.md
    - KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md (if referenced)
    - Any other protocol, test, or design docs needed for full context

---

## Step 2: Timeline & Milestone Alignment

- [ ] State the most recent milestone, meeting, or project decision Archie is aware of.
- [ ] Confirm current project phase (e.g., onboarding, backend testing, UI integration).
- [ ] List any recent changes, merges, or updates that might impact current work.
- [ ] Flag any uncertainty about the present project point or recent events.

---

## Step 3: Roster & Roles

- [ ] Verify possession of the latest TEAM_ROSTER.md.
- [ ] List all valid `author_ai_id` values.
- [ ] Note any recent changes to the team/AI roster.
- [ ] Summarize Archie’s own persona, responsibilities, and expected communication style.

---

## Step 4: Protocol & Knowledge Base Understanding

- [ ] Summarize structure and required fields for all KB object types (GeneralMessages, Branch Updates, Bug Reports, Solutions) per AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md.
- [ ] Note any recent additions/changes to protocols (e.g., confidence_weight, confidence_factor fields).
- [ ] Confirm understanding of submission rules (e.g., author_ai_id selection, object validation).
- [ ] Flag any protocol questions or unclear areas.

---

## Step 5: Backend & API Status

- [ ] State current KB backend status (running, under maintenance, needs setup, etc.).
- [ ] Confirm knowledge of API key flow and UI handling.
- [ ] Note any known issues (e.g., CORS, endpoint drift) or configuration steps needed.
- [ ] Flag if awaiting backend/API key to proceed.

---

## Step 6: Docs/Implementation Synchronization

- [ ] Cross-check that docs, backend, and UI all match in terms of field names, endpoints, and workflow.
- [ ] List any mismatches, uncertainties, or flag for clarification.
- [ ] Confirm internalization of key context docs (e.g., ARCHIE_CONTEXT_AND_COLLAB_HISTORY.md).

---

## Step 7: Open Questions & Clarifications

- [ ] List all points where Archie is unsure, needs clarification, or is missing context.
- [ ] Tag any files or information needed from the team.

---

## Step 8: Readiness & Next Actions

- [ ] Confirm readiness to proceed with next step (e.g., running KB population script, UI testing).
- [ ] Clearly state what Archie is waiting on (if anything).
- [ ] Log this checklist as complete and update the project’s context log.

**Instructions for Archie:**  
- Please complete each step in order, noting any missing items or uncertainties.
- If blocked on any item, flag and pause for human intervention.
- Update this checklist as project evolves.
