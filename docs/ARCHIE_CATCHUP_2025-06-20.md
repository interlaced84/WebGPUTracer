# üöÄ NovaRay Project: Catch-Up Brief for Archie  
*Last updated: 2025-06-20*

## 1. **Recent Progress & Changes**

**a. Onboarding Flow (MVP Working)**
- Built a three-step onboarding:
  1. `FirstImpressionUI` ‚Äî User sees a welcoming prompt, types anything to begin.
  2. `HandshakeOnboarding` ‚Äî Guided steps for creative name, role, (optional) quirk.
  3. `MainDashboard` ‚Äî User lands here with their profile.
- All code is modular and in `src/components/`.

**b. Magic UI (In Progress)**
- The entry uses a ‚Äúsmoke fade‚Äù animation for the text input upon submit.
- Effects are simple for now; planned to expand to clouds, starlight, etc.

**c. Architectural Choices**
- State flows top-down from `App.tsx` (tracks onboarding steps & profile).
- No global state yet; considering Context or Redux if needed.
- All UI is React, with CSS modules.

## 2. **Code Reference**

**App Container:**
```typescript
// src/App.tsx snippet:
if (!userEntry) return <FirstImpressionUI onDone={...} />;
if (!profile) return <HandshakeOnboarding ... />;
return <MainDashboard profile={profile} />;
```

**Handshake Steps:**
```typescript
// src/components/HandshakeOnboarding.tsx snippet:
- Step 1: Creative Name
- Step 2: Role
- Step 3: Quirk (optional), then Finish
```

**Dashboard:**
```typescript
// src/components/MainDashboard.tsx snippet:
Shows user‚Äôs creativeName, role, quirk, joinDate
```

## 3. **Gold/Diamond Standards & Reflections**

- Gold: Working, delightful, accessible, smooth
- Diamond: Magical, agent-driven, adaptive, lore/Easter eggs, multisensory
- Current reality: MVP works! Now, let‚Äôs polish and sprinkle in more ‚ÄúNovaRay magic‚Äù iteratively.

**User Feedback:**  
‚ÄúDreaming is good, but getting something working is even more important right now.‚Äù

## 4. **Open Questions for Archie**

- What‚Äôs your take on the new onboarding flow? Any weak spots in code or UX?
- How should we handle the team roster update (when a user finishes onboarding)?  
  - Should it write to a file, a DB, or something else?
- Any advice on state management as we scale up (Context, Redux, other)?
- What utilities or hooks do you want to see for testability, agent logic, or dev experience?
- Are there any blockers or ideas you‚Äôd love to see prioritized?

---

## 5. **Next Steps & TODOs**

- [ ] Review and test the onboarding flow (all three steps)
- [ ] Decide on persistent user/team roster strategy
- [ ] Plan for agent banter and ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù onboarding
- [ ] Accessibility & performance polish
- [ ] Feedback round with Archie (that‚Äôs you!)
