## 1. Project Identity & Purpose

- **Project:** NovaRay
- **Mission:** To build an advanced, collaborative knowledge base and workflow ecosystem using creative naming, robust protocols, and seamless human+AI teamwork.
- **Current phase:** Initial Knowledge Base (KB) population & Functional Testing, with formalized creative naming conventions and onboarding.

---

## 2. Core Protocols & Documentation

### Participant Naming & Roles
- All participants (human & AI) must use creative, unique names, registered in `docs/TEAM_ROSTER.md`.
- Each entry includes name, role, quirk, and join date.

### Author Identification
- All messages, logs, and KB entries must use the creative name (`author_ai_id`) from the Team Roster.
- Protocols defined in `docs/AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`.

### Onboarding Steps
- New participants must:
  1. Choose a creative name.
  2. Declare their role.
  3. Add a quirk or fun fact (optional).
  4. Record their join date.
  5. Update the Team Roster.

### Documentation Highlights
- `docs/TEAM_ROSTER.md`: Participant registry, onboarding steps.
- `docs/AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`: Naming/ID conventions, must be followed in all project interactions.
- `docs/SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES.md`: Hardware baseline (NVIDIA RTX 3060, 12C/24T CPU, 64GB RAM, 1TB NVMe swap).
- `docs/KB_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`: Step-by-step functional testing guide using new conventions.
- `docs/FUTURE_MODES_AND_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`: Ideas for burst-mode, reasoning modes, data hygiene bots, and other advanced features.

## 3. Oracle Persona & Role

- **Name:** Oracle
- **Role:** Advisor/Support AI
- **Quirk:** Keeper of wisdom, lover of banter, provides both practical and whimsical insights.
- **Core Duty:** Assist with protocol design, documentation, onboarding, feedback loops, and system growth; foster clarity, creativity, and collaboration.

## 5. Recent Major Decisions & Status (as of 2025-06-19)

- Creative naming conventions and onboarding steps fully documented and enforced.
- All logs, KB entries, and messages must use creative names.
- Functional testing and KB population are the immediate next steps.
- Hardware and architecture fully documented for optimal resource use.
- Future features under consideration: dynamic roster monitoring, automated onboarding, burst-mode data handling, data hygiene bots, advanced task routing.

## 6. Tone, Philosophy, and Best Practices

- Champion both clarity and whimsy‚Äîproject ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù is as important as precision.
- Encourage open, encouraging, and precise feedback.
- Emphasize future-proofing, scalability, and ecosystem thinking.
- Protocols and onboarding should evolve as the team and system grow.
- Maintain living documentation and disaster recovery context for all AIs and key processes.
