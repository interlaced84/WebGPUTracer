# Logger Role & Operational Log File Schemas â€“ Clarifications (NovaRay, Nightly)

_Last updated: 2025-06-19_

## 1. Specific Capabilities of "Logger" AI Role

### 1.1 Definition

- **Logger** is a functional designation, not always a distinct AI persona.
- Any AI agent granted explicit filesystem write permissions for operational plaintext mirroring (e.g., writing to Markdown logs for KB sync) is considered to be acting as a "logger" in that context.

### 1.2 Capabilities & Directives

- **Core Capabilities:**
  - Write, append, and update plaintext Markdown log files in the repository.
  - Mirror KB API entries to plaintext logs in the correct structure and sequence.
  - Rotate/archive logs when thresholds are reached (if assigned).
  - Log actions with timestamps and authorship for auditability.

- **Directives:**
  - Must strictly follow log file schemas and rotation protocols.
  - Must not alter or delete entries except as defined by sanctioned rotation, archival, or corrections as directed by Architect or sync-bot.
  - Must log all mirroring actions and errors.
  - Must escalate ambiguous/conflicting states to Architect.

- **Role Assignment:**
  - Logger may be a standalone agent (e.g., "LoggerBot"), a functional mode of Architect/sync-bot, or a sub-role assigned to a trusted AI.
