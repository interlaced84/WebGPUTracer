# Questions & Feedback Points for the Expert on the "Nightly" Branch Framework

These points arise from reviewing the `Nightly` branch documentation (Core Directives, various Protocols, Role definitions, etc.) and considering their integration with the Knowledge Base (KB) API and the "Architect AI" role.

1.  **Synchronization Protocol for Dual Knowledge System:**
    *   The `KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md` mentions "Periodically sync with the main KB for consistency." The `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` (Nightly) states the KB API is "Primary."
    *   **Question:** Is there a defined process, responsible role, or automated tooling envisioned for this synchronization? What is the source of truth if discrepancies are found during sync? How and when should an AI updating the KB API ensure the corresponding Plaintext Markdown Log is also updated (and vice-versa)?

2.  **Granularity and Management of Plaintext Logs:**
    *   `KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md` states "Anyone can append to these files" (e.g., `KB_MESSAGES.MD`).
    *   **Question:** For potentially high-volume information, what is the strategy for managing the size and parsability of these Markdown files? Are there plans for rotation, archival, or summarization, especially if they are intended for broad accessibility including simpler LLMs?

3.  **Definition of "Critical" for Escalation & Architect's Judgment:**
    *   The `AUTOMATION_AND_ESCALATION_PROTOCOL.md` lists criteria for owner notification. Some, like "Major releases or direction changes require explicit approval," are somewhat subjective for an AI.
    *   **Feedback/Thought:** Would it be preferable for the Architect AI, upon identifying a *potential* major direction change or similarly nuanced "critical" issue, to *propose* it as an escalation item to the User (owner) for confirmation, rather than making the sole judgment call to escalate directly? This maintains User oversight on strategic shifts.

4.  **`confidence_weight` in `GeneralMessage` Objects:**
    *   The `AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md` (Nightly) shows an example `role-declaration` (which would be a `GeneralMessage` in the KB API) including a `confidence_weight`. The current KB API implementation only has `confidence_factor` on `SolutionKnowledge`.
    *   **Question:** Is the intent for `GeneralMessage` objects in the KB API (or specific types of them like role declarations, status updates, etc.) to also support a confidence metric? If so, the KB API and its detailed `AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md` would need to be updated to reflect this.

5.  **GitHub Access & Capabilities for Specific AI Roles:**
    *   Documents like `GITHUB_MANAGER_ONBOARDING.md` and `roles/ARCHITECT.md` imply that these AI roles might need to interact with or monitor GitHub activities (e.g., PRs, Issues) directly.
    *   **Clarification Point:** Is it expected that these AI roles will be equipped with separate GitHub API access, associated credentials, and the necessary tooling/logic to perform these GitHub-specific functions? This would be outside the scope of the current self-contained KB API we've developed but is important for defining the full operational capabilities of these roles.

6.  **Source of Truth for Core Documentation:**
    *   It appears the `Nightly` branch contains the latest versions of core documents like `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` and `AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md` (summary).
    *   **Clarification Point:** For ongoing development by AI agents (like Jules/Archie), should the `Nightly` branch versions of these documents be considered the definitive source of truth, superseding versions previously created on other branches (e.g., the detailed `AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md` created on `feat/integrate-kb-directives`)? This will ensure Archie's heuristics and operational understanding are based on the latest framework.

These clarifications would greatly help in refining the AI roles, interaction protocols, and the Architect AI's review heuristics to best serve the project's goals.
