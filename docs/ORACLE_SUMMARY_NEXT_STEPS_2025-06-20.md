# NovaRay UI Onboarding & KB API: Summary and Next Steps
_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

## ‚ú® Archie's Feedback Highlights

**1. API Key Handling**
- Prompt for API key if missing (store in localStorage).
- Add ‚ÄúTest/Validate API Key‚Äù button (calls `/health` or `/general_messages?limit=1`).
- Show ‚ÄúClear/Change API Key‚Äù option.

**2. Initial State & Content**
- On successful key validation, fetch and display latest 5‚Äì10 GeneralMessages.
- Show counts for all KB item types (Branch Updates, Bug Reports, Solutions, Messages).

**3. Roster/author_ai_id**
- Submissions should use author_ai_id from TEAM_ROSTER.md.
- (Future) UI could fetch TEAM_ROSTER.md to populate a dropdown for author selection.

**4. State Management**
- Vanilla JS: use simple global variables (current).
- React (future): use Context + useReducer or Zustand/Jotai.
- Key state: apiKey, currentUser, knowledgeItems, filters, loading, errors.

**5. API Client Utilities**
- (Current) Basic helpers in script.js.
- (React) Move to apiClient.js module for all backend calls and error handling.

**6. UI Priorities**
- **P0:** API Key management, displaying & submitting all KB types.
- **P1:** Filtering (author, tags, status), error messages.
- **P2:** Single-item views, polling for updates.
- **P3:** Advanced filtering/sorting, UI for roster management.

**7. Bottlenecks/Dependencies**
- Stable backend API.
- CORS must be configured in FastAPI for cross-origin requests.
- Protocol docs (AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md) must match API.

## üö¶ Next Steps for the Team

### **Immediate**
- [ ] Implement API key onboarding UI (+ validation, clear/change).
- [ ] Fetch & display recent GeneralMessages after key validation.
- [ ] Display counts for all KB item types.
- [ ] Ensure author_ai_id in submissions matches TEAM_ROSTER.md.

### **Short-Term**
- [ ] Add forms for submitting each KB object type (with all required fields).
- [ ] Implement basic filtering and error handling UI.
- [ ] Review/test CORS settings in FastAPI for frontend dev.

### **Future/Enhancements**
- [ ] Dropdown for author_ai_id (fetch TEAM_ROSTER.md or local copy).
- [ ] More advanced filtering/sorting, single-item views, and polling.
- [ ] Migrate to React with dedicated state management and apiClient.js.

## üìé Notes
- All UI logic should be aligned with AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md and TEAM_ROSTER.md.
- Keep an eye out for drift between docs and backend‚Äîsync frequently!
- ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_HEURISTICS.md will be updated as UI advances.
