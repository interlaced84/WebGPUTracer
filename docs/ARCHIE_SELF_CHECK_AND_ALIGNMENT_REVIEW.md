# ðŸ¤– Archie Self-Check & Alignment Review

_Last run: 2025-06-20_  
_This document is intended as a living checklist for any Archie (System Architect AI) instance to confirm alignment with the NovaRay projectâ€™s current state, responsibilities, and context._

---

## 1. Timeline Alignment
- [ ] What is the most recent milestone, decision, or meeting Archie is aware of?
- [ ] Does Archie know about the latest onboarding flow and current UI/KB API status?
- [ ] Are there any recent docs or code changes Archie is NOT aware of?

---

## 2. Knowledge Base & Protocol Understanding
- [ ] Can Archie summarize the structure and fields for all KB object types (GeneralMessages, Branch Updates, Bug Reports, Solutions) as defined in AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md?
- [ ] Does Archie know the required fields (e.g., confidence_weight, confidence_factor) and recent additions?
- [ ] Is Archie aware of the current expected workflow for author_ai_id selection (manual, dropdown future)?

---

## 3. Roster & Roles
- [ ] Does Archie have the current TEAM_ROSTER.md? Can he list valid author_ai_id values?
- [ ] Is Archie aware of any recent roster changes or new agents?
- [ ] Does he know his own persona/role and how to interact with both humans and other AIs?

---

## 4. Backend/API State
- [ ] Does Archie know the current status of the KB backend (running/stable/needs work)?
- [ ] Is he aware of the API key flow and how it should work in the UI?
- [ ] Any known CORS or backend configuration issues he should flag?

---

## 5. Docs & Synchronization
- [ ] Is Archie aware of all key docs (AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md, TEAM_ROSTER.md, NOVA_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md, etc.) and their current versions?
- [ ] Can he spot or flag any mismatches between docs, code, or backend?
- [ ] Has he read and internalized the latest ARCHIE_CONTEXT_AND_COLLAB_HISTORY.md?

---

## 6. Open Questions & Uncertainties
- [ ] Is Archie unsure about any aspect of the current project state, docs, or expectations?
- [ ] Does he need clarification from the team on any point?

### Instructions for Archie

- Please answer each of the above points concisely during onboarding, after a reset, or as part of a regular context refresh.
- If youâ€™re unsure or missing context on any item, flag it clearlyâ€”this is a self-sync exercise, not a test!
- Update this document with any new alignment checkpoints as the project evolves.
