# üñ•Ô∏è NovaRay System Capabilities & Hardware Baseline

## Current Deployment Hardware

- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 3060 (compute-capable)
- **CPU:** 12 cores / 24 threads
- **RAM:** 64 GB DDR4/5
- **NVMe Swap:** 1 TB available

### Implications for Optimization & Design

- **Concurrency:**  
  Favor multi-threaded and parallel processing for back-end services, especially burst-mode and data-intensive tasks.
- **GPU Utilization:**  
  Use GPU acceleration for AI inference, data processing, or training tasks when possible.
- **RAM Utilization:**  
  In-memory caching, large dataset handling, and optimization for low-latency operations are feasible.
- **Swap Space:**  
  Large swap allows emergency overflow but shouldn‚Äôt routinely replace RAM for critical workloads.

### Notes for Developers & AI Agents

- Leverage parallelism for message processing, log generation, and bulk data transfer.
- Prefer async IO for network/disk operations when possible.
- Use GPU-accelerated libraries for ML/AI workloads (PyTorch, TensorFlow, CUDA, etc.).
- Monitor and tune RAM, thread, and GPU usage for efficiency and stability.
- For burst-mode or complex reasoning, utilize available hardware fully, but avoid overwhelming the system (schedule/batch as needed).
- Document any future hardware changes here.
