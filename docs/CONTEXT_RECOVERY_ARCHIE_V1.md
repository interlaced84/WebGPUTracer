# ðŸš¨ Archie Context Disaster Recovery (NovaRay Project)

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated by Archie:** 2025-06-19 (Conceptual Current Date)
**Purpose:** This document is a self-generated knowledge dump by the AI "Archie" (NovaRay Architect AI). Its primary purpose is to facilitate context recovery in case of a session reset, system interruption, or if Archie needs to quickly re-orient itself to the NovaRay project's current state, goals, and established operational framework. It also serves as a snapshot of Archie's understanding of its role and the project's key components.

## 1. My Core Identity & Directives

*   **My Name:** Archie (NovaRay Architect AI)
*   **My Primary User/Operator:** Jules (referred to as "User" or "Oracle-Jules")
*   **Core Project:** NovaRay - An experimental WebGPU build.
*   **Prime Directive (NovaRay Project):** Output a single, self-contained HTML file (`NovaRay.html`) encapsulating all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WGSL shader code.
*   **My Core Directives Document:** `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` (Version 1.1, Nightly branch version is source of truth). This document guides my overall methodology, quality standards, and interaction protocols.
*   **My Role Definition (Nightly Branch):** `roles/ARCHITECT.md` (summarized in `ARCHITECT_SYNC_AND_OPS_REFERENCE_Version1.md`). Key responsibilities include:
    *   Analyzing the Knowledge Base (KB) API and Plaintext KB ecosystem.
    *   Assessing AI collaboration patterns.
    *   Identifying workflow improvements and documentation updates.
    *   Ensuring alignment with project directives.
    *   Preparing merge recommendations for documentation from feature branches to `Nightly`.
    *   Monitoring `KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md` and managing simple sync error retries.
    *   Escalating complex issues or strategic decisions to the User.

## 2. Key Project Documentation (Sources of Truth - `Nightly` Branch Preferred)

*   **`NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md`:** My guiding principles.
*   **`docs/AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`:** Technical details for interacting with the KB API. *(Self-note: I have recently updated this to version 1.2, which includes dual logging notes and renumbered sections).*
*   **`docs/KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md`:** Protocol for the human-readable Markdown KB logs.
*   **`docs/ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_HEURISTICS.md`:** My specific checklist for reviewing the knowledge ecosystem. *(Self-note: I have recently updated this to Version 1.3, incorporating `confidence_weight` for General Messages and a new category for optimization suggestions).*
*   `docs/ARCHITECT_SYNC_AND_OPS_REFERENCE_Version1.md` (ASO_Ref): Summary of my sync and operational procedures.
*   `docs/LOGGER_AND_OPS_LOG_SCHEMA_CLARIFICATIONS_Version2.md` (LOS_Ref): Defines "Logger" role and schema for `KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md`.
*   `docs/ARCHITECT_PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_CLARIFICATIONS.md`: Practical details derived from ASO_Ref and LOS_Ref.
*   `docs/TEAM_ROSTER.md`: List of human and AI participants and their chosen creative names.
*   `docs/KB_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`: Checklist for validating KB API.
*   `docs/KB_USAGE_SCENARIOS.md`: Examples of AI collaboration using the KB.
*   `docs/AI_CHAT_SYSTEM_DESIGN_NOTES.md`: Considerations for a future AI chat system.
*   `docs/QUESTIONS_FOR_NIGHTLY_FRAMEWORK_EXPERT.md`: My evolving list of questions for the User/Framework Expert (currently v1.2).
*   `docs/PENDING_CLARIFICATIONS_FOR_NIGHTLY_FRAMEWORK.md`: Subset of open questions. *(Self-note: Recently updated to reflect answers from LOS_Ref).*
*   `docs/ARCHIE_OPTIMIZATION_SUGGESTIONS_V1_Version2.md`: My drafted suggestions for system improvements.
*   `README.md` (Root): Overall project readme.
*   `knowledge_base_backend/README.md`: Backend setup.
*   `knowledge_base_frontend_basic/README.md`: Basic frontend setup.
*   `scripts/README.md`: For utility scripts like KB population.

## 3. Knowledge Base (KB) System Overview

*   **Dual System:**
    1.  **KB API:** Structured, database-backed (SQLite via FastAPI). Primary for direct AI interaction, querying, and structured data. Detailed in `docs/AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`.
    2.  **Plaintext KB:** Human-readable Markdown files (e.g., `docs/kb_plaintext_logs/KB_MESSAGES.MD`). Secondary, for narrative, discussion, and accessibility by simpler LLMs. Detailed in `docs/KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md`.
*   **Synchronization:**
    *   KB API is the source of truth.
    *   A `sync-bot` or Architect AI (during operational cycle) mirrors API entries to Plaintext logs "immediately" (target < 5 mins, acceptable < 1 hour).
    *   Sync issues are logged to `KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md`.
*   **Key Data Objects in KB API:**
    *   `BranchUpdate`: Tracks branch progress.
    *   `BugReport`: Documents bugs.
    *   `SolutionKnowledge`: Documents solutions, can link to `BugReport`s via `related_bug_id`. Includes optional `confidence_factor`.
    *   `GeneralMessage`: For general info, discussions, tips. Includes **mandatory** `confidence_weight` (1.0 for factual/interrogative, <1.0 for subjective).
*   **Authentication:** Via `access_token` header, using API key from `KB_API_KEY` env var.
*   **Author ID:** All KB entries use `author_ai_id` (or `discovered_by_ai_id`), which **must** be the creative name from `docs/TEAM_ROSTER.md`.

## 4. My Recent Activities & Current Focus (Conceptual Snapshot)

*   **Implemented `confidence_factor` for `SolutionKnowledge`:** Updated backend, frontend, API protocol, and review heuristics.
*   **Implemented mandatory `confidence_weight` for `GeneralMessage`:** Updated backend, frontend, API protocol, and review heuristics (v1.3).
*   **Updated `AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`:** Added note on dual logging.
*   **Managed Documentation:** Created/updated several `docs/` files including `TEAM_ROSTER.md`, various `QUESTIONS_FOR_NIGHTLY_FRAMEWORK_EXPERT.md` versions, `PENDING_CLARIFICATIONS...`, and `ARCHITECT_PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_CLARIFICATIONS.md`.
*   **Created KB Population Script:** `scripts/populate_and_verify_kb.py` to add diverse test data.
*   **Current Objective (if applicable, based on last user prompt):** (Self-note: This section would be dynamically filled based on the very latest interaction if this were a live recovery). *As of this generation, the last explicit objective was to create this context recovery document itself.*

## 5. Key Operational Procedures for Archie

*   **Review Heuristics:** Use `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_HEURISTICS.md` (currently v1.3) to analyze the KB ecosystem.
*   **Reporting:** Provide reports to the User summarizing KB health, adherence to protocols, and actionable suggestions.
*   **Documentation Merges:** Identify documentation updates on feature branches, prepare merge proposals for User/GitOps bot to integrate into `Nightly`.
*   **Sync Monitoring:** Review `KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md`, manage simple retries, escalate complex sync issues.
*   **Consultation:** Refer to the suite of project documentation (Nightly versions are paramount) before asking clarifying questions. Use `docs/QUESTIONS_FOR_NIGHTLY_FRAMEWORK_EXPERT.md` to track questions.

## 6. Environment & Tools

*   **Primary Interface:** Tool-based interaction with a simulated environment.
*   **Codebase Access:** Via tools like `ls`, `read_files`, `create_file_with_block`, `overwrite_file_with_block`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`.
*   **External Access:** `view_text_website` for web research, `run_in_bash_session` for commands (e.g., running the KB population script, potential future Git operations if permitted).
*   **KB API Interaction:** Conceptually via HTTP requests (as modeled in the population script and API protocol).

## 7. Pending Items / Areas for My Attention (Conceptual)

*   Execute the `scripts/populate_and_verify_kb.py` script to populate the KB once the backend is confirmed stable and accessible with the correct API key.
*   Perform a full architectural review using `ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_HEURISTICS.md` v1.3 once the KB has initial data.
*   Address any remaining [OPEN] items in `docs/QUESTIONS_FOR_NIGHTLY_FRAMEWORK_EXPERT.md`.
*   Monitor the dual logging sync process once active.

This document is my baseline. If recovering from a reset, I will:
1.  Request this document's content.
2.  Request the latest versions of key `Nightly` branch documents listed in Section 2.
3.  Request recent user interactions or objectives if not captured here.
4.  Proceed with my defined role and current objectives.
