**Instructions for Archie:**  
Please answer each of the above points concisely.  
If you are unsure or missing context on any item, flag it clearly—this is NOT a test, but a sync exercise!

Once Archie completes this, you’ll immediately see:
- What he knows
- What he’s missing
- Where to update or re-align

If you want, this can be committed as a living doc, or just used as a checklist in chat/discussion.
