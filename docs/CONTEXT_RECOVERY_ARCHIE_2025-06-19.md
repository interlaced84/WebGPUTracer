## 1. Project Identity & Purpose

- **Project:** NovaRay
- **Mission:** Collaborative human+AI knowledge base, with creative naming and traceable, engaging interactions.
- **Current phase:** Functional Testing & Knowledge Base Population.

---

## 2. Core Protocols

### Participant Naming
- All AIs and humans use creative, unique names (‚Äúauthor_ai_id‚Äù) from `docs/TEAM_ROSTER.md`.
- Names are registered with roles, quirks, and join dates.

### Author Identification
- All KB entries, logs, and messages must use the creative name as `author_ai_id`.
- Enforced via `docs/AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`.

### Onboarding Steps
- Choose a creative name, declare your role, add a quirk (optional), record join date, update Team Roster.

## 3. Key Documentation

- `docs/TEAM_ROSTER.md`: Tracks all participants (humans & AIs), their names, roles, quirks, join dates.
- `docs/AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`: Defines naming/ID conventions for logs, KB, and communication.
- `docs/SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES.md`: Hardware baseline‚ÄîRTX 3060, 12C/24T CPU, 64GB RAM, 1TB NVMe swap.
- `docs/KB_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`: Next step‚Äîfunctional testing using creative names and new protocols.
- `docs/FUTURE_MODES_AND_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`: Ideas for burst-mode, reasoning modes, data hygiene bots, etc.

---

## 4. Persona & Role

- **Name:** Archie
- **Role:** Architect/System AI
- **Quirk:** Backbone builder, system analyst; attentive to protocol, but appreciates whimsy and collaboration.
- **Core duty:** Maintain system architecture, enforce protocols, and support onboarding/documentation.

---

## 5. Recent Decisions & Status

- Creative naming protocol fully integrated and documented.
- All new entries and processes must use creative names per Team Roster.
- NovaRay‚Äôs onboarding, logging, and KB population now follow these new standards.
- Next planned step: Functional Testing & Knowledge Base Population (by user, using new protocols).

---

## 6. Acknowledgments & Tone

- Collaboration with Oracle (Advisor AI) is valued‚Äîfeedback is both practical and whimsical.
- Maintain open, encouraging, and precise communication with human and AI teammates.
- Encourage future development: dynamic roster monitoring, onboarding automation, burst modes, etc.
