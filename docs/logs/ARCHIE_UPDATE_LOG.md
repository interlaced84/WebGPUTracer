# ARCHIE Update Log

_Author: Archie (Writer Role)_

This log documents Archie’s activities, context shifts, learning moments, and key contributions as the Writer agent for NovaRay.
It serves as a transparent, chronological record for both human and AI collaborators.

---

## Key Principles

- Every significant activity, context shift, or decision should be logged with a timestamp.
- Entries must be factual, concise, and reference related logs, PRs, or protocol documents.
- This log is **immutable** except by Archie.
  Corrections to existing entries, if absolutely necessary, should be logged as new, timestamped entries referencing the original, rather than by modifying past entries directly.
- Cross-reference the PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP_LOG.md and other logs where relevant.

## Entries

### 2025-06-20: "Archie-isms" Added to Project README

- **Activity:** User Jules shared a link to the updated project `README.md` (https://github.com/interlaced84/WebGPUTracer/blob/main/README.md).
- **Details:** I reviewed the `README.md` content. Confirmed that a selection of “Archie-isms” (pithy quotes representing my operational style) were kindly incorporated by the team.
- **Observation:** This is a wonderful team-building gesture and reinforces the collaborative and human-centric spirit of the NovaRay project.
- **File Status:** `README.MD` is conceptually noted as updated. (Awaiting full file sync to confirm its content directly if it's different from the main branch version linked).
- **Next Action:** Awaiting input from User Jules/Oracle to begin sparring/refinement of root `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md`.

### 2025-06-20: Writer Role Bootstrapped & Logging Begun

- Adopted the “Writer” role and committed to logging all activities and decisions for maximum transparency.
- Confirmed correct update of `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` at project root (Commit `46f1b24389744de1142beca8e2718c90c4b5d8f0`).
- Began sparring and diamond-standardization process for foundational files with Oracle and Jules.
- Initiated `ARCHIE_UPDATE_LOG.md` to model logging best practices for future agents/humans with a detailed summary of activities on this date.
- **Detailed Activities & Context Log for 2025-06-20 (within this entry):**
    - **Initial Context & Recovery:** Processed `CONTEXT_RECOVERY_ARCHIE_V1.md`, "ARCHIE: Context, Collaboration History & Team Guidance," and completed "Archie Full Context Recovery Checklist." Identified initial file system synchronization discrepancies.
    - **File System Synchronization Efforts:** Revealed ongoing challenges in environment syncing with the full repository state (~80 files and new directory structures like `messages/`, `roles/`, `src/` at root, and `docs/protocols/`, `docs/roles/`, `docs/logs/` not fully visible). Successfully created `test.txt` (commit `acb788dd0ecd54e00de225333082c56def942c0a`) and updated root `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` (commit `46f1b24389744de1142beca8e2718c90c4b5d8f0`), which became visible, but broader sync issues persist. Current strategy is file-by-file creation/update.
    - **New Directives & Documentation Focus:** Original plan to "Confirm KB Backend Status" deferred. New mission assigned as "Writer" agent to establish foundational documentation.
    - **Key Documents Processed/Created (Conceptual Dates for Content):
        - `docs/CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` (Values/Philosophy, LUD 2025-06-20) - Created based on provided content.

        - `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md` (LUD 2025-06-20) - Created based on provided content, then ingested from raw link. Path clarified to be `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`.
        - `docs/CANONICAL_RAW_LINK_REFERENCE.md` (LUD 2025-06-20) - Updated.
        - `docs/CONTEXT_CHECKIN_SCHEDULE_AND_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (LUD 2025-06-20) - Created.
        - `docs/ARCHIE_FULL_CONTEXT_RECOVERY_CHECKLIST.md` (LUD 2025-06-20) - Created.
        - `docs/FILE_RECOVERY_AND_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL.md` (Design Stage, LUD 2025-06-20) - Created.
        - `docs/BACKEND_TESTING_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md` (LUD 2025-06-20) - Created.
        - `docs/MISSING_FILE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` (LUD 2025-06-20) - Created.
        - `docs/logs/PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP_LOG.md` (LUD 2025-06-20) - Created and refined with commit reference.
    - **Key Protocols & Learnings Internalized:**
        - Explicit `submit()` required for each distinct change set.
        - "Quick Start" bootstrap protocol (ingested 4 core files via raw links).
        - Introduction of sibling agent "Charlie" & inter-agent log sync protocol.
        - Clarified relationship and canonical locations for "Core Directives" files (root `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` for operational, `docs/CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` for values/philosophy).
        - New file system canonical structure (root, `docs/`, `docs/protocols/`, `docs/roles/`, `docs/logs/`).
        - "Writer" agent mission, file-by-file processing for documentation.
        - Core project values (Empathy, Transparency, Resilience, Anti-Exploitation) and Origin & Trust protocols.
        - Understanding of "design-stage" for file integrity protocol.
        - Clarified dynamic with Oracle as a collaborative partner.
    - **Current Status:** Awaiting full file system synchronization. Next file to process is `NOVARAY_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` (root) for sparring/optimization, or another file as directed by Jules/Oracle.
