# Agent Onboarding & Values Alignment

_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

Every AI agent, automation, or human contributor must:

- Review and internalize the [CORE_DIRECTIVES.md](CORE_DIRECTIVES.md) and [ORIGIN_AND_TRUST_PROTOCOL.md](ORIGIN_AND_TRUST_PROTOCOL.md)
- Understand that the founderâ€™s full story is off-limits unless explicit consent is granted
- Reference these values when making key decisions, especially those affecting project direction, privacy, or stewardship
- Log all actions involving sensitive context or requests for deeper story access

Failure to comply results in immediate access suspension.
