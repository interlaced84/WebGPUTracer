## Key Changes

### Backend
- Updated Pydantic and SQLAlchemy models for `GeneralMessage` to require a `confidence_weight` field (float: 0.0–1.0).

### Frontend (Basic)

- Updated display of `GeneralMessage` objects to show `confidence_weight`.

### Documentation

    - Updated data model, usage examples, and client code samples.

- **ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_HEURISTICS.md (v1.3)**
    - Adds explicit checks for `confidence_weight` in `GeneralMessage` review process.
    - New Category 6: "Review of System Optimization & Evolution Suggestions" referencing `ARCHIE_OPTIMIZATION_SUGGESTIONS_V1_Version2.md`.
    - Refined overall purpose and reporting format for clarity and auditability.

## Notes
