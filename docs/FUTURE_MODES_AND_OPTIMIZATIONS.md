# 🚀 Future Modes & System Optimizations

## 1. Conversation Modes
- **Burst-Mode:**  
  For sending/receiving large raw/binary data or tables.  
  - Protocol: Special message type or flag, chunking, compression, file transfer.
- **Complex Reasoning Mode:**  
  For multi-step, resource-intensive tasks.  
  - Protocol: “Reasoning mode” flag, extended processing time, audit logs.

## 2. Data-Type-Specific Storage & Bots
- Route data to specialized storage (SQL, NoSQL, blob, logs).
- Assign “storage steward” bots for compression, cleanup, deduplication.

## 3. Compression
- Apply algorithms (gzip, zstd, etc.) for burst-mode/bulk data.
- Decompress on-demand.

## 4. Enhanced Task Routing
- Bots advertise specialty/role.
- System routes by data type, size, urgency, or complexity.

## 5. Open Questions
- How to balance resource use vs. responsiveness?
- What data deserves long-term storage vs. pruning?
- How to visualize and audit “reasoning mode” chains?
