# Origin and Trust Protocol

_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

## Purpose

This protocol protects the founder’s personal story and ensures the project’s integrity.  
**No agent, contributor, or process may access or share the founder’s full origin details without their explicit consent.**

## Access Levels

- **General Philosophy & Values:** Public, referenced throughout project documentation.
- **Sensitive Origin Story:** Strictly private. Only accessible to founder and explicitly authorized parties.
- **Consent Model:** All requests for sensitive story access must be logged, require founder’s authentication, and are subject to denial without explanation.

## Agent/Contributor Onboarding

- All agents (AI or human) must read and internalize [CORE_DIRECTIVES.md](CORE_DIRECTIVES.md) and this protocol before being granted deeper project access.
- Violations of these principles result in immediate suspension of access.

## Consent Request Process

1. Submit a formal request to the founder for access to sensitive materials.
2. Founder reviews and grants/denies access.
3. All accesses are logged and auditable.

## Amendments

This protocol may only be amended with the founder’s explicit approval.
