_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

## 1. Recent Conversation Summary (Archie & Team)

**Archie:**  
- Reviewed new and existing markdown files in docs/ (including AI_CHAT_SYSTEM_DESIGN_NOTES.md, ARCHIE_RESPONSE_ONBOARDING_BRIEF_V1.md, KB_USAGE_SCENARIOS.md, TEST_PLAN.md, and others).
- Noted missing docs: KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md and LOGGER_AND_OPS_LOG_SCHEMA_CLARIFICATIONS_Version2.md (LOS_Ref), which are referenced by other files and important for the dual-logging system.
- Stated readiness to proceed with backend testing once the KB backend is operational and the API key is provided.

**User/Team:**  
- Confirmed that more historical and critical docs have been added for Archie’s review.
- Requested Archie to re-examine the docs/ directory and process all available information.
- Reassured Archie that full context and missing info will be provided before backend testing begins.

**Archie (after review):**  
- Completed review of all available docs.
- Confirmed enhanced understanding of the KB system, project history, and test plan.
- Reiterated the need for the missing logging-related docs for full clarity.
- Stated preparedness for the next step, pending backend/API key.

## 2. Current Project Sync Status

- **Archie’s Context:**  
    - Archie is now fully updated on available project docs and historical context, except for a few missing files (see below).
    - Clear on testing workflow, protocols, and his role.
- **Outstanding Gaps:**  
    - `docs/KB_PLAINTEXT_PROTOCOL.md` — Referenced in several places, needed for dual-logging clarity.
    - `docs/LOGGER_AND_OPS_LOG_SCHEMA_CLARIFICATIONS_Version2.md` (LOS_Ref) — Important for reporting/logging mechanisms.
- **Next Agreed Action:**  
    - Once backend is confirmed running and API key available, run `scripts/populate_and_verify_kb.py` to seed/test KB and verify API functionality.

## 3. Next Steps (as of 2025-06-20)

1. **User/Team:**  
    - Ensure the KB backend is up and accessible.
    - Provide Archie with the current KB_API_KEY and backend access details.
    - Supply any other missing or critical documentation if/when available.

2. **Archie:**  
    - Execute the KB population script: `scripts/populate_and_verify_kb.py`
    - Report on success/failure, and log any issues or gaps encountered.
    - Continue to flag/document any uncertainties or missing pieces.
