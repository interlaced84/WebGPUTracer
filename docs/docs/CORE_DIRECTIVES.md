# CORE DIRECTIVES – NovaRay Project

_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

## Philosophy & Values

NovaRay was founded on the belief that technology should heal, empower, and illuminate. It is guided by:

- **Empathy:** Every system must support and protect the vulnerable.
- **Transparency:** Actions must be visible, auditable, and explainable.
- **Resilience:** Self-healing, context-recovering systems are a top priority.
- **Anti-Exploitation:** This project’s intent and outcomes must never be twisted or commodified without integrity.

## Origin & Trust

The founder’s personal journey—marked by resilience, loss, and a search for meaning—inspires these values.  
**Full origin details are private and may only be shared with explicit, written consent from the founder.**

## Stewardship Protocol

- All contributors, agents, and automated processes must act in accordance with these Core Directives.
- Any major decision that could affect the project’s meaning, purpose, or privacy must be reviewed in light of these principles.
