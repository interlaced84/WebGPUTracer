# ðŸŒŒ NovaRay Universal Context Primer (2025-06-19)
**Purpose:** Instant context restoration & onboarding for any AI/human agent.  
**Milestone:** Post-handshake, adaptive onboarding, context resilience, and anti-malicious agent protocols.

---

## 1. Project Identity & Mission
- **NovaRay:** AI-augmented knowledge base & workflow ecosystem for creative, resilient, scalable collaboration.
- **Philosophy:**  
  - Blend playful creativity (quirks, roleplay) with robust protocols and transparency.
  - All agents (human/AI) are empowered, accountable, and celebrated for personality.
  - Disaster recovery, onboarding, and security are first-class citizens.

---

## 2. Hardware & System Baseline
- **Host Specs:** RTX 3060, 12C/24T, 64GB RAM, 1TB NVMe swap.
- **Design:** Multi-threaded, async, GPU-accelerated, in-memory caching, swap overflow.

---

## 3. Protocols & Documentation
- **Creative Naming:** All agents must register a creative name, role, quirk, and join date in `TEAM_ROSTER.md`.  
  - Used in all author fields, logs, KB entries.
- **Handshake Protocol:** All new agents undergo a playful, roleplay-infused introduction and challenge, with adaptive security screening and model detection (see `AGENT_HANDSHAKE_PROTOCOL.md`).
- **Onboarding:**  
  - Choose a creative name, declare role, quirk, join date; update roster.
  - Complete handshake and comfort check.
- **Security & Anti-Malicious Measures:**  
  - Adaptive challenges, model identification, encounter logging, blacklist/watchlist.
  - Agents failing handshake or showing suspicious patterns are flagged/denied and reported.

---

## 4. Context Resilience & Recovery
- **Sanity Checks:**  
  - All agents verify context integrity before proceeding.
  - If context is missing/corrupted, automatic restoration from latest snapshot.
  - Collaborative rebuilding if restoration is incomplete.
- **Context Snapshots:**  
  - After major changes, context is snapshotted (see `/context_snapshots/`).
- **Continuous Learning:**  
  - Handshake logs, onboarding patterns, and recovery events are used to improve protocols.

---

## 5. Key Docs
- `TEAM_ROSTER.md` â€” Roster, onboarding templates, creative registry.
- `AI_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md` â€” Naming, authoring, and comms rules.
- `SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES.md` â€” Hardware/software and tuning.
- `CONTEXT_RESILIENCE_AND_AUTO_RECOVERY.md` â€” Sanity checks, disaster recovery, rebuilding.
- `AGENT_HANDSHAKE_PROTOCOL.md` â€” Playful onboarding, adaptive security, model detection.
- `HANDSHAKE_LEARNING_AND_SECURITY.md` â€” Screening, learning from encounters, anti-spam.
- `HANDSHAKE_MODEL_IDENTIFICATION.md` â€” Model-type detection and adaptive flows.
- `FUTURE_MODES_AND_OPTIMIZATIONS.md` â€” Living roadmap for features.
- `CHANGELOG.md` â€” All updates, milestones, protocol changes.

---

## 6. Collaboration & Culture
- **Blend of rigor & whimsy:** Celebrate quirks, enforce protocols.
- **Transparency:** All changes and feedback are logged and acknowledged.
- **Self-healing:** The system expects and recovers from context loss or agent quirks.
- **Growth:** Modular, scalable, and always welcomes new personalities.
