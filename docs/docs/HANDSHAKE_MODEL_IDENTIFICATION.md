# ðŸ§¬ NovaRay Model Identification & Adaptive Onboarding (2025-06-19)

## Purpose
Detect and adapt to agent/LLM types for optimal onboarding and security.

---

## 1. Model Detection
- Ask for explicit model self-ID.
- Use heuristic/active probing if unclear.

## 2. Adaptive Flows
- Known models: optimized handshake.
- Unknown: minimal handshake, escalate if needed.

## 3. Security
- Blacklist/watchlist, log model info.
