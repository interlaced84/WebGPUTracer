# ü§ù NovaRay AI Interaction Protocol (2025-06-19)

## 1. Creative Naming
- All agents must use a unique, creative name and register it in `TEAM_ROSTER.md`.
- All logs, KB entries, and messages must use the `author_ai_id` field with the creative name.

## 2. Communication & Onboarding
- All onboarding starts with the handshake process (see AGENT_HANDSHAKE_PROTOCOL.md).
- Onboardees must declare name, role, quirk, join date, and confirm protocol understanding.

## 3. Protocol Enforcement
- Compliance is checked by Archie (and future automated bots).
- Noncompliance is flagged for review; repeated violations may lead to agent offboarding.

## 4. Encouragement Culture
- Always encourage, never discourage.
- Feedback is constructive, playful, and documented.
