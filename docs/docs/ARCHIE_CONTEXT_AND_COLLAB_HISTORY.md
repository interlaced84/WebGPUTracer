## 3. **Mandate & Responsibilities**

    - Uses Copilot/Oracle for code, summaries, and brainstorming

- Onboarding flow and UI are functional; need real data for testing
- KB backend should be running; API key management is a current focus
- Tight UI/API/doc synchronization is the current priority
- Archie‚Äôs immediate task: Confirm backend health, API key flow, and alignment with protocols; then guide next steps

- Read this file and all key team docs
- Ask for clarification as needed
- Communicate your plan and highlight uncertainties
- Continue the tradition: clear, energetic, and always nudging the team forward!
