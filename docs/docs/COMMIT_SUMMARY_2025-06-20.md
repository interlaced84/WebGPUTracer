# Commit Summary – Vision & Protocol Alignment (2025-06-20)

## Purpose
This commit realigns all project documentation and onboarding with our set-in-stone vision, ethics, and operational protocols. It explicitly encodes empathy, transparency, resilience, and anti-exploitation as core values, and ensures the founder’s personal story is protected by robust consent protocols. All agents and contributors are required to onboard with these directives before deeper project participation.

## Files Added/Updated

- **docs/CORE_DIRECTIVES.md**  
  Codifies project philosophy, values, and stewardship protocols; references trust and consent policies.
- **docs/ORIGIN_AND_TRUST_PROTOCOL.md**  
  Details access levels, consent requirements, and onboarding for sensitive information.
- **docs/FOUNDER_ORIGIN_PRIVATE.md**  
  Placeholder for founder’s personal story; access strictly limited by protocol.
- **docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md**  
  Mandates onboarding and adherence to values/trust directives for all agents and contributors.
- **docs/CANONICAL_RAW_LINK_REFERENCE.md**  
  Provides canonical GitHub raw link format for file recovery and reference.
- **docs/BACKEND_TESTING_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md**  
  Step-by-step checklist for backend population, testing, and onboarding.
- **docs/MISSING_FILE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md**  
  Standard template for reporting missing or outdated documentation/files.

## Alignment
- All documents are fully realigned with the latest vision and protocols.
- No sensitive details are exposed without explicit founder consent.
- Onboarding, actions, and decisions across the project are now explicitly governed by these values and protocols.

**This commit establishes a new baseline for project integrity, ethics, and future collaboration.**
