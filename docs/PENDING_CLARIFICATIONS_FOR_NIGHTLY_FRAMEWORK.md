# Pending Clarifications for the "Nightly" Branch Framework

**Source Document Version:** `QUESTIONS_FOR_NIGHTLY_FRAMEWORK_EXPERT.md` v1.2
**Date Extracted:** 2025-06-19 (Conceptual Current Date)

This file lists questions that remain open or are newly raised after reviewing `ARCHITECT_PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_CLARIFICATIONS.md` (ASO_Ref_Practical).

---

1.  **Specific Capabilities of "Logger" AI Role:**
    *   Context: ASO_Ref_Practical Section 1 mentions a "logger" agent as potentially responsible for plaintext mirroring.
    *   **Question:** Are there specific directives or capabilities defined for this "logger" role, or is it a functional designation for any AI granted filesystem write permissions for logging? Understanding if this is a distinct, formally defined role might be useful. (Original Status: [OPEN])

2.  **Format/Schema for `KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md` and `KB_LOG_INDEX.md`:**
    *   Context: ASO_Ref_Practical mentions these files.
    *   **Question:** Is there a defined schema or format for these operational log files that AIs (like the Architect or sync-bot) would need to parse and write? (Original Status: [OPEN])
