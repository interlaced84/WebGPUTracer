# Pending Clarifications for the "Nightly" Branch Framework

**Source Document Version:** `QUESTIONS_FOR_NIGHTLY_FRAMEWORK_EXPERT.md` v1.2
**Date Updated:** 2025-06-19 (Conceptual Current Date)

This file lists questions that remain open or are minor follow-ups after reviewing `ARCHITECT_PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_CLARIFICATIONS.md` (ASO_Ref_Practical) and `LOGGER_AND_OPS_LOG_SCHEMA_CLARIFICATIONS_Version2.md` (LOS_Ref).

---

1.  **Specific Capabilities of "Logger" AI Role:**
    *   **Status: [ANSWERED]** LOS_Ref Section 1 defines the "Logger" as a functional designation with specific capabilities and directives.

2.  **Format/Schema for `KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md` and `KB_LOG_INDEX.md`:**
    *   **`KB_SYNC_REPORTS.md` Schema:**
        *   **Status: [ANSWERED]** LOS_Ref Section 2 provides a clear Markdown schema for this file.
    *   **`KB_LOG_INDEX.md` Schema:**
        *   Context: ASO_Ref_Practical and LOS_Ref mention this file in relation to log rotation and indexing archives.
        *   **Question:** Is there a defined schema or an example format for `KB_LOG_INDEX.md` that AIs (like the Architect or sync-bot) would need to parse and write? (Original Status: [OPEN] - This remains a minor open point for full operational clarity, but not a blocker for current development).

---
Summary: Most critical operational questions have been clarified by recent documentation. The primary remaining ambiguity for future reference is the specific schema for `KB_LOG_INDEX.md`.
